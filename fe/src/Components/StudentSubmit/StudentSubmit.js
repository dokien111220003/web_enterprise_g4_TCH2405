            feedback: "This final submission is comprehensive and reflects significant improvement from the initial drafts. The depth of analysis in your results section is commendable, and your conclusions are logically drawn from the data presented. Itâ€™s evident that a lot of effort went into ensuring the accuracy of the data and the clarity of your arguments. On the improvement side, while your report is generally well-written, there are several instances of repetitive phrasing that could be streamlined to enhance readability. Additionally, the visual aids are helpful but could be better integrated into the text with more detailed captions explaining each figure and table. Incorporating these changes will not only improve the aesthetic appeal but also the informational value of your submission. Great job overall, and with a few tweaks, your work could truly excel."
